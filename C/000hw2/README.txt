p1: this code is for multiplying, dividing, moding, adding and subtracting two very big numbers(even longer than the long type, but maximum 20 digits).

NOTE1: it is calculated for the situation 'x is bigger than y'


p2: imagine a mouse that walks within a 50 by 50 array. The mouse holds a pen in one of two positions: up or down. While the pen is up, the mouse does not write anything. While the pen is down, the mouse marks each array location it passes by. You will read a sequence of commands (one per line) from standard input (I suggest using an input text file and use input redirection) and walk the mouse. The mouse always starts at location (0,0) with its pen up. 

NOTE2: it takes the commandations from readThis.txt
