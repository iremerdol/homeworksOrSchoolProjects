since the beginning of time,
he's been looking for some peace of mind,
after goodness and evil was created,
neither heaven nor hell had participated,
graceful and gifted one then said,
remember how i've sincerely prayed,
it was indeed desperation,
like trying to avoid a perdition,
leant on a mossy wall, he was dying,
and at the very end, silently crying.
